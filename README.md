# ThreeJS
This is a test application for learning the ThreeJS framework in order to render 3D models in a web browser and enhance my personal web 
design capabilities.

### Required dependencies 
You must have **NodeJS** installed so that you are able to use node package managager to download the dependencies.
To do this simply run '_**npm i**_' in the terminal and it will install node_modules into the program.

The dependencies that this program requries are:

* Three": ^0.110.0
* http-server: ^0.110.1

### Running the program
There is only one script needed to run the program if you have installed node_modules.

Enter '_**npm run start**_' into the terminal and the program will open in a browser.

You will see a localhost address, at the end of it add '**/index.html**' to access the webpage.
